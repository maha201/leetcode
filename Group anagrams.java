/*

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.



For example, given: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],

Return:

[

  ["ate", "eat","tea"],

  ["nat","tan"],

  ["bat"]

]



Note: All inputs will be in lower-case.

/**

 * Approach 1: Categorize by Sorted String

 * Intuition

 * Two strings are anagrams if and only if their sorted strings are equal.

 *

 * Complexity Analysis

 *  Time Complexity: O(NKlog(K)), where N is the length of strs, and K is the maximum length of a string in strs.

 *  The outer loop has complexity O(N) as we iterate through each string.

 *  Then, we sort each string in O(KlogK) time.

 *  Space Complexity: O(N*K), the total information content stored in ans.

 *  This Method is quiet apparently and easy.

 *  You can get the code and explanations here:

 *  https://leetcode.com/articles/group-anagrams/

/**

 * Approach 2: Categorize by Count

 * Intuition

 * Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts

 * (respective number of occurrences of each character) are the same.

 *

 * Algorithm

 * We can transform each string s into a character count, currMap, consisting of 26 non-negative integers representing

 * the number of a's, b's, c's, etc.

 * We use these counts as the basis for our hash map.

 * the string(key) represent the count of each characters.

 * For example, "abbccc" will be 12300...00 where there are 26 entries total.

 * As fro each anagrams, the key is unique.

 *

 * In the Solution of LeetCode Article, it use '#' to split the count of each character.

 * It says that: Without '#', the currMap "12" could represent 12 a's or 1 a and 2 b's. It make us confused.

 * Well, it's true in partial string.

 * But as for the whole string, it will be different.

 * The string with 12 a's will has 1 more 0 in the string at least, compared with

 * the string with 1 a and 2 b's. So they could be recognized.

 *

 * Complexity Analysis

 *  Time Complexity: O(N*K),

 *  where N is the length of strs, and K is the maximum length of a string in strs.

 *  Counting each string is linear in the size of the string, and we count every string.

 *  Space Complexity: O(N*K), the total information content stored in ans.
